# Codebook for fullset (data frame)

subject: factor, unique identifier for each subject in the raw data, consecutive 1:30

activity: factor, description of activity with levels walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

Followed by mean and standard deviations for each measured variable. Measurements are assumed to be in SI units 
(acceleration in meters per second squared, angular velocity in degrees of rotation per second). 

Measurements are described in time and frequency domains. 
t denotes time domain signals:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag

f denotes frequency domain signals (Hz) generated by fast Fourier transform: 
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

# Codebook for aggmeans

Similar strucutre of data, except the table is summarized by subject * activity pairs. The mean value for each
variable in fullset is displayed for each pair.
